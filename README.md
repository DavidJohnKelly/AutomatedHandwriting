# Automated Handwriting
## _Convert a text file into a handwritten note_


## Features

- Import an image of a set of handwritten characters and TensorFlow will automatically assign the correct character
- Import a text file and it will generate a HTML file with your created characters with random variance where applicable


## Tech

Automated Handwriting uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [MyHandWriting] - creates the HTML file from the character files
- [SimpleHTR] - version of TensorFlow specifically adapted for handwritten characters
- [Pillow] - Python image manipulation capabilities

## Installation

AutomatedHandwriting requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads//) v3.8+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
pip install -r (Path)\AutomatedHandwriting\requirements.txt
```
